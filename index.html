<h2>Expectations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Certain applications should only be accessible to owner of the object.</li>
<li>Each object must have a clear owner in the class</li>
<li>Each object must have full permissions (including Avalumni leveraged and purchased &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;textures).</li>
<li>Each object must be assigned to i467 2015</li>
<li>Each owner will have a copy of their object in their inventory</li>
<li>Each owner will lock down the object on CODE FREEZE day.</li>
<li>Will have rooms that can be reserved. The person reserving the room decides who is allowed to enter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Every room will have a button that can be pressed to hide objects in the room from view. The same button also returns the objects to their original location. The button will have the following text above it: &ldquo;Press to hide objects in room, press again to return them.&rdquo; &nbsp;The button can be disabled by presenters to prevent accidents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Will have rooms/spaces specifically designed for:</li>
<ul>
<li>Creating and testing tools. Will have introductory building tutorials, tools and starter prims, and empty platforms to build on. Will take place in the building/tool space.</li>
<li>Presentation Hall. Will seat 50 people, will provide screens for video and powerpoint slides, will have smaller &lsquo;break-out&rsquo; rooms for smaller discussions.</li>
<li>Plaza. Collaboration and discussion. Will have interactive whiteboards that users can post on by typing into chat.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A wearable will be made/purchased that can be used to ask questions and give replies. It will also keep track of group participation. (e.g. After asking a question, the wearable would display text reading &ldquo;26/30 people have responded to the question&rdquo;). Will have buttons that users can click to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; and for raising their hand to get the presenter&rsquo;s attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Updates below)</p>
<p><strong>HUDs</strong><br />We will be creating a HUD that enables users to teleport to any location in the lab. <br />A scavenger (ex. find 20 items) activity will be created to encourage participation and exploration, with a leaderboard as the reward. <br />A "Help Me" button will direct users to FAQs.</p>
<p><strong>Central Plaza</strong><br />There will be a suggestion box located here for feedback and comments from visitors.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Orientation (formerly "Hall")</strong><br />We felt that a better experience would be to present tutorials as signs and/or activities along a pathway. The users would go through it in order to reach the Central Plaza. We were inspired by Sylvan Grove on campus--an iconic landmark, open outdoor space, and pathways leading into it.</p>
